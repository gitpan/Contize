Contize version 0.1
====================

Fake Continuations for a Perl Object

Contize is a sort of proxy object. You create an instance of your original
object, and then give it to Contize.  Contize then takes over that object (and
you work with the Contize object but pretend it is still the original) and lets
the object pretend that it can be suspended and restarted.

This is a pretty trick concept, and the best way to get your brain around the
whole thing is to contemplate why I created it in the first place, namely so
that I can do Continuation-based Web Programming in Perl CGI programs.

Thats all for now... see the website for more info.
